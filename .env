# --- resi: upstream (dialer) node selection ---
# The residential proxy can "dial out" through a normal node group (dialer-proxy).
# Think of it as: ① choose upstream node(s)  -> ② exit via residential IP.
#
# Default: use ALL normal nodes as dialer candidates.
# If you want only a subset (e.g. US nodes), use regex mode.
#
# IMPORTANT: use an ENGLISH comma "," (not "，") for all comma-separated values.

# all | regex
RESI_DIALER_MODE="all"

# Only used when RESI_DIALER_MODE=regex.
# Example (match "US" or "美国" in node names):
#RESI_DIALER_REGEX="(US|美国)"
# Example (match 🇺🇲 / 🇺🇸 flags):
#RESI_DIALER_REGEX="(🇺🇲|🇺🇸)"

# Naming (optional): customize group/proxy names shown in the client UI.
# If you don't care, keep defaults.

# Compatibility note:
# - RESI_GROUP_NODE_SELECT_NAME is only used if that group name actually exists in your YAML.
# - If your subscription uses a different "main select" group name, set it here.
# - If the script can't detect the group safely, it will SKIP rewriting it (to avoid breaking non-standard YAML).
#   You can also force skipping with:
#RESI_SKIP_NODE_SELECT_REWRITE="true"

# RFC1918 LAN ranges (comma-separated).
# IMPORTANT: use an ENGLISH comma "," (not "，").

# Domains you want to ALWAYS go DIRECT (comma-separated).
# Open-source default example uses baidu.com; replace with your own domains.
# IMPORTANT: use an ENGLISH comma "," (not "，").
BYPASS_DOMAINS="baidu.com"

# Which DNS should be used to resolve BYPASS_DOMAINS:
# - "system" / "auto"  -> detect via macOS `scutil --dns`
# - "10.0.0.2,10.0.0.3" -> explicit DNS list
# If you don't need per-domain DNS, you can leave this empty.
BYPASS_INTERNAL_DNS="system"

# --- Relationship / when you need what ---
# 1) BYPASS_DOMAINS -> adds:
#    - rules: DOMAIN-SUFFIX,<domain>,DIRECT
#    - dns.fake-ip-filter: +.<domain>
#    - (optional) dns.nameserver-policy for +.<domain> when BYPASS_INTERNAL_DNS is set
#
# 2) BYPASS_IP_CIDRS -> adds:
#    - tun.route-exclude-address (mihomo only)
#    - rules: IP-CIDR,<cidr>,DIRECT,no-resolve
#
# Do you need BYPASS_IP_CIDRS if you already added BYPASS_DOMAINS?
# - For public domains like baidu.com -> usually NO.
# - For internal services resolving to 10.x/172.16-31/192.168.x,
#   or apps connecting directly by IP -> YES (recommended).
